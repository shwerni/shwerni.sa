## 2026-09-30 · Step 0 hotfix, tier 1: account takeover chain and account edits

**Files changed**

- `tsconfig.json`: `"docs"` added to `exclude`. The build failed type-checking `docs/reference/example/visibility-switch.tsx`, which imports `@/actions/consultant` (not created yet).
- `handlers/auth/verify.ts`:
  - `checkToken(token)` returns only `{ phone: maskPhone(tokenExist.phone) }`. It no longer returns the OTP or the name (neither page displays the name).
  - `verifyToken(token, otp)` now takes the token instead of the phone, reads the phone from the token record, and checks `expire`.
- `handlers/auth/reset.ts`: `verifyReset(data, token)` gets the same change: phone from the token record, `expire` checked.
- `data/verificationTokens.ts`: token expiry is 10 minutes (was 1 hour).
- `app/(pages)/(auth)/verify-otp/page.tsx`, `app/(pages)/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`: pass `phone` (masked) and `token`. The OTP is no longer in the page payload.
- `components/auth/verify-otp.tsx`, `components/auth/reset-password-form.tsx`: props are `{ phone, token }`, and the verify call sends `token`. Markup unchanged.
- `utils/phone.ts`: new `maskPhone` (first 3 and last 4 digits).
- `handlers/auth/userInfo.ts`: `userInfoChange`, `userPasswrodChange` and `unauthorizedPhoneChangeByToken` take the account from `userServer()` and ignore the id / old-phone argument. Signatures are unchanged. No session returns the existing messages.

**Verified**

- `npm run build`: passes.
- Manifest: 304 functions still exposed, as expected until tier 4.
- The manifest check in CLAUDE.md prints nothing even when `data/` files are exposed: `(^|/)` never matches a path that starts right after a quote. A working check is `grep -oE '"(data|handlers|lib)/[^"]*"' .next/server/server-reference-manifest.json | sort -u`, which prints 55 files after this tier.

**Needs manual testing in the browser**

- Register, then OTP verify, then redirect to `/login`.
- Forget password, then reset with OTP, then `/login`.
- `/verify-otp` and `/reset-password` show the masked phone. The WhatsApp help link on `/verify-otp` also carries the masked phone.
- Dashboard profile: change name/email, change password, change phone. Each should work while logged in.

**Open questions for review**

- The OTP is 5 digits and there is no attempt limit; this is still brute-forceable until rate limiting exists.
- Existing bug, left as is: `userInfoChange` calls `getUserByEmail(id)` with the user id instead of the email.
